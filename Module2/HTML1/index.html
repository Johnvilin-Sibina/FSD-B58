        An actor or actress is a person who portrays a character in a
        production. The actor performs "in the flesh" in the traditional medium
        of the theatre or in modern media such as film, radio, and television.
        The analogous Greek term is ὑποκριτής (hupokritḗs), literally "one who
        answers". The actor's interpretation of a role—the art of
        acting—pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or
        fictional character. This can also be considered an "actor's role",
        which was called this due to scrolls being used in the theaters.
        Interpretation occurs even when the actor is "playing themselves", as in
        some forms of experimental performance art. Formerly, in ancient Greece
        and the medieval world, and in England at the time of William
        Shakespeare, only men could become actors, and women's roles were
        generally played by men or boys. While Ancient Rome did allow female
        stage performers, only a small minority of them were given speaking
        parts. The commedia dell'arte of Italy, however, allowed professional
        women to perform early on; Lucrezia Di Siena, whose name is on a
        contract of actors from 10 October 1564, has been referred to as the
        first Italian actress known by name, with Vincenza Armani and Barbara
        Flaminia as the first primadonnas and the first well-documented
        actresses in Italy (and in Europe). After the English Restoration of
        1660, women began to appear onstage in England. In modern times,
        particularly in pantomime and some operas, women occasionally play the
        roles of boys or young men.
